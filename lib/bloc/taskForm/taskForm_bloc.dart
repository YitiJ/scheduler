//* Using a shortcut getter method on the class to create simpler and friendlier API for the class to provide access of a particular function on StreamController
//* Mixin can only be used on a class that extends from a base class, therefore, we are adding Bloc class that extends from the Object class
//NOTE: Or you can write "class Bloc extends Validators" since we don't really need to extend Bloc from a base class
class Bloc extends Object with Validators {
  //* "_" sets the instance variable to a private variable
  //NOTE: By default, streams are created as "single-subscription stream", but in this case and in most cases, we need to create "broadcast stream"
  //Note(con'd): because the email/password streams are consumed by the email/password fields as well as the combineLastest2 RxDart method
  //Note:(con'd): because we need to merge these two streams as one and get the lastest streams of both that are valid to enable the button state
  //Note:(con'd): Thus, below two streams are being consumed multiple times

  //NOTE: We are leveraging the additional functionality from BehaviorSubject to go back in time and retrieve the lastest value of the streams for form submission
  //NOTE: Dart StreamController doesn't have such functionality
