//* Using a shortcut getter method on the class to create simpler and friendlier API for the class to provide access of a particular function on StreamController
//* Mixin can only be used on a class that extends from a base class, therefore, we are adding Bloc class that extends from the Object class
//NOTE: Or you can write "class Bloc extends Validators" since we don't really need to extend Bloc from a base class

  //Note(con'd): because the email/password streams are consumed by the email/password fields as well as the combineLastest2 RxDart method
  //Note:(con'd): because we need to merge these two streams as one and get the lastest streams of both that are valid to enable the button state
  //Note:(con'd): Thus, below two streams are being consumed multiple times
