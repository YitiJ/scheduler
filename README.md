# Scheduler

Aiming to create an application to keep track of how you distributed your time throughout the day, your todo list of the day, and tasks.

* **User-defined** todo, task, and category.
* **Local SQLite Database** to store todos, categories, and histories.
* **Visualize** your todo completion rate with a line graph.
* **Calendar and timeline** to display your time distribution.
