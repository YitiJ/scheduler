# Scheduler

Aiming to create an application to keep track of how you distributed your time throughout the day, your todo list of the day, and tasks.

* **Timer** to track your current task
* **User-defined** todo, task, and category
* **Local SQLite Database** to store todos, categories, and histories
* Visualize your todo completion rate with a **line graph**
* **Calendar and timeline** that display your time distribution
